# 🐍💧🔫 Snake-Water-Gun Game

A simple **Snake-Water-Gun** game implemented in Python.  
This is similar to Rock-Paper-Scissors, but with **Snake, Water, and Gun**.

---

## 🎮 Rules of the Game
- **Snake (s)** drinks **Water (w)** → Snake wins 🐍
- **Water (w)** douses **Gun (g)** → Water wins 💧
- **Gun (g)** shoots **Snake (s)** → Gun wins 🔫
- If both players choose the same → It's a **Draw** 🤝

---

## 🛠 How It Works
- The **computer** makes a random choice: `Snake`, `Water`, or `Gun`.
- The **player** inputs their choice (`s`, `w`, or `g`).
- The winner is decided based on the rules above.
